# What's the Difference of Building a Smart Contract, a Parachain & a Parathread?
I will attempt to contrast the development of a smart contract &amp; the development of a parachain.

### What's a Smart Contract?

An Ethereum smart contract is a computer program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It executes automatically when certain conditions are met, and it cannot be changed once deployed. Smart contracts are useful for executing financial transactions, voting, auctions, and more, and they enable new forms of decentralized applications and organizations. Overall, smart contracts increase trust, efficiency, and innovation in a variety of industries.

### What's a Parachain?

A parachain is a separate blockchain that can communicate with other blockchains and shares security with a relay chain. This means that it can benefit from the security of the relay chain and can communicate with other blockchains that are also connected to the relay chain.

Parachains provide more space and flexibility for developers to create custom features and applications. They can be used to create things like custom monetary systems, voting systems, or governance mechanisms that can be tailored to specific needs.

### What's a parathread?
On the other hand, a parathread is also a separate blockchain that can communicate with other blockchains. However, it is designed to be less expensive to use than a parachain. Parathreads only produce a block when necessary, which means they can save on resources and are better suited for applications that do not require frequent updates.

Both parachains and parathreads provide customization options for developers, allowing them to create new types of applications that were not possible before. However, the main difference is that parachains provide more space and flexibility, while parathreads are more cost-effective and suitable for applications that require less frequent updates.
